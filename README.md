# Tools in Data Science : Project 1

* **Approach :** Using the GitHub API, data of all <u>Barcelona</u>-based users with 100+ followers, and their repositories were scraped and was saved in CSV format. To automate the process I used Python's `requests` library and made a script to fetch the data.

* **Analysis Insights :** Javascript (6089 repos) dominates as the primary language in repositories, followed by Python (2177 repos). Additionally, user "cfenollosa" has repositories with an exceptionally high average star count, indicating popularity and community interest.

     Vim Script tops as the language with highest average number of stars per repository.

* **Actionable Recommendation :** Developers in Barcelona could focus on JavaScript and Python, which are highly adopted locally, and aim to create well-documented, community-oriented projects to gain visibility, as seen by the popularity of top users.
